I'm giving you a night call
To tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night
Down the hills

I'm gonna tell you something
You don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dumped
But have no fear

There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
There's something inside you, boy
And you're still the same

I'm giving you a night call
To tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night
Down the hills

I'm gonna tell you something
You don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dumped
But have no fear

There's something inside you
And it's hard to explain
They're talking about you, boy
But you're still the same

Tell you how, tell you how
Tell you how

I'm giving you a night call
To tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night
Down the hills

I'm gonna tell you something
You don't want to hear
I'm giving you a night call
To tell you how I feel
And how I feel
